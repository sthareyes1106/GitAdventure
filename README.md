# GitHub Exercise

(Submitting the repo in which I followed the steps)

Hello, future software developer! In this exercise, we’ll practice GitHub via GitHub Desktop. 🐙

You’ll follow the same tasks from the Git exercise to compare and contrast the command line with GitHub Desktop.

Your tasks are:

1. **Installation**: Download and install GitHub Desktop from [the official website](https://desktop.github.com/).
2. **Configuration**: Set your global username and email in GitHub Desktop's preferences.
3. **Initialization:**
    - Create a new repository named `GitAdventure`.
    - Find and open the repository folder on your computer.
4. **Staging and Committing:**
    - Inside `GitAdventure`, create `journey.txt`. Write: "Starting my Git journey."
    - Stage `journey.txt`.
    - Commit your changes.
5. **Deletion:**
    - Create `temp.txt` with the content: "This file is meant to be deleted." Then, stage and commit.
    - Delete `temp.txt` from the folder. Commit the deletion in GitHub Desktop.
6. **Renaming:**
    - Rename `journey.txt` to `adventure.txt`.
    - Update its content to: "My journey evolves into an adventure with Git."
    - Stage and commit your changes.
7. **Ignoring Files:**
    - Create a `.gitignore` file to ignore all files ending with `.log`. Stage and commit.
    - Test by creating a `test.log` file and check if it's ignored in GitHub Desktop.
8. **Diving Deeper:**
    - Change `adventure.txt` to add "Exploring the depths of Git commands and their powers."
    - View changes in GitHub Desktop.
    - Stage and commit your changes.
9. **History and Restoration**:
    - Browse your repository's commit history in GitHub Desktop to see your progress.
    - Try to revert `adventure.txt` to an earlier state. Hint: GitHub Desktop does not offer direct revert based on commit ID.
    

Happy coding!
